# 🌍 Neighbor Explorer – HTML | CSS | JavaScript

Neighbor Explorer is a country information app that lets users input the name of a country and instantly view its details, such as population, region, language, and currency. If the country has neighboring countries, those are also fetched and displayed using the REST Countries API.

The primary aim of this project was to practice working with REST APIs, managing asynchronous fetch requests, and displaying nested dynamic content (like neighbors of neighbors). It also helped reinforce UI rendering based on conditional data availability.
